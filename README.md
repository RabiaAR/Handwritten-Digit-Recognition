# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. The system can accurately classify digits from 0 to 9 based on handwritten input.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize pixel values of the MNIST dataset for optimal training.
- **Model Creation**: Build and train a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Test the model on the test dataset and achieve high accuracy.
- **User Interface**: An interactive interface allowing users to draw digits and receive predictions in real-time.
